Experiment 2 from my Master Thesis

Different information criteria are used to infer an optimal number of knots for the model.
This example project requires the monkey dataset to be accessible by the user. If it is not, it must be replaced by some other data to run the project.
Also it requires bootstrap data, the path of which has to be specified. If not bootstrap data is available, the jobs should be removed.
